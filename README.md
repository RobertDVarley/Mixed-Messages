# Mixed Messages
This was part of the mixed messages project from CodeCademy.

This code was made through Visual Code Studio, recognised as JavaScript by saving it as a .js file. This ran in Node, and the debug console showed this to work by generating a mixed message of a composer (12 in total), location action (4 in total), location list (12 in total), verb (12 in total), and other person list (12 in total). This was followed by a function to create random text, creating a random number based on the input array, choosing random indexes from the different arrays before putting it together with interpolation and console log additions ('Did you know?' and '?')

## Step one: Plan your project

I visualised the end result, aided by a *KANBAN* organiser. I answered these questions:
*What is it built with?* It is built using Visual Studio Code, saved as a .js file- ran through the Node.JS console (in my case, the legacy console worked). 
*What can it do?* It can generate random messages.

I made sure to avoid complicating the plan by not adding unnecessary code to it. By setting firm boundaries, I was able to prevent [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep).

## Step two: Come up with a topic

+ I came up with a topic to provide a random message made of five parts in all. 
+ These parts have been explicitly mentioned above. 

## Step three: Create Script and run it locally

+ I created the JavaScript by coding it with Visual Studio Code.
+ I ran it locally and saw that this worked with Node.Js.

## Step four: Set up version control

+ I set up version control by creating a git repository, then pushing the js file to it through Visual Studio COde (via the console)
+ I tested this by changing the code in Visual Studio Code which made changes in GitHub. 

## The final steps

+ I put the program together by creating the messages and storing the message components.
